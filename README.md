# Learning C++
This repository is a structured collection of everything I am learning about C++. It is organized into topics in the order I learned them, making it easier to follow along.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured into folders, each representing a major topic. Inside each folder, there are source files for the codes with executables omitted for each specific lesson along with practice programs.

## 📖 Topics Covered
1. **Basics** (Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Namespaces, Arithmetic, Type Conversion, Input Handling)
2. **Control Flow** (If-Else, Switch, Ternary Operator, Logical Operator)
3. **Loops and Iteration** (While, Do-While, For Loops, Break & Continue, Nested Loops)
4. **Randomization** (Random Number Generation, Random Event Generation)
5. **Functions and Scope** (User-Defined Functions, Recursion, Overloading, Variable Scopes)
6. **Arrays** (1D & Multidimensional Arrays, Array Methods, Searching & Sorting)
7. **Pointers and Memory** (Pointers, Memory Addresses, Dynamic Memory, Pass-by-Reference vs. Value)
8. **Structs and Enums** (Grouping Related Variables, Structures, Enumerations)
9. **Object-Oriented Programming** (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Constructors, Encapsulation)

## 📌 How to Use
- Each topic folder contains commented lessons and example programs.
- Navigate through the folders in sequence or jump to a specific topic.
- Run the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler (g++, clang, MSVC, etc.).

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/curtainteddy/Learning-CPP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a topic folder:
   ```sh
   cd Learning-CPP/01_Basics
   ```
3. Compile and run the executable file:
   ```sh
   g++ .\01_variables.cpp -o .\01_variables && .\01_variables
   ```
